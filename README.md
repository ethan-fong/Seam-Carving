# Seam-Carving
C implementation of an image processing technique that removes "low energy" pixels while still preserving important features. This project makes use of dynamic programming in order to find the vertical path that results in the lowest energy pixels being removed. 

An example of the seam carving algorithm in action using the C code in this repository:
